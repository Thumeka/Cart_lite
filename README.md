# Introduction
The CartLite project, initially designed as a comprehensive e-commerce platform, is taking a strategic pivot to concentrate on the grocery segment, particularly emphasizing specials and deals that offer significant value to budget-conscious shoppers. This shift is motivated by the growing demand for online grocery services and the unique opportunity to cater to consumers looking for deals and savings in their everyday shopping.
