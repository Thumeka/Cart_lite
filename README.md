# Cart_lite

# Introduction
The CartLite project, initially designed as a comprehensive e-commerce platform, is taking a strategic pivot to concentrate on the grocery segment, particularly emphasizing specials and deals that offer significant value to budget-conscious shoppers. This shift is motivated by the growing demand for online grocery services and the unique opportunity to cater to consumers looking for deals and savings in their everyday shopping.

The focus on grocery specials is expected to position CartLite as a go-to platform for savings-oriented grocery shoppers, offering a unique value proposition in the competitive online grocery market. Future enhancements will continue to build on this foundation, further personalizing the shopping experience and expanding the range of specials available
